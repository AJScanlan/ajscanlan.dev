                This is where I publish essays, field notes, and technical explorations — 
                mostly about philosophy, systems, decentralization, and how we make sense of complexity.

                        Short reflections, usually stemming from a quote I found insightful or thought-provoking.
                        Borrowing the classical "On..." format as playful homage.

                        I hope to better my communication skills through explanations, and to show my struggles and failures openly.

            <h2>How I work</h2>
            
            <p>
                I follow what I call <strong>structured provisionalism</strong>: stating clearly 
                what I'm confident about, what I'm uncertain of, and what would falsify my thinking.
                I aspire to build up my knowledge and opinions bit by bit, provisionally but with structure, to hopefully avoid hubris and unearned conviction.
                You'll often find a section at the end of longer posts that makes this explicit.
            </p>

            <p>
                The design philosophy here is <em>clarity over flair</em>. Typography-first, 
                minimal UI, generous white space. I want the writing to breathe. The red fox 
                mark represents alertness and curiosity — qualities I aspire to in my thinking.
            </p>

                    Each piece is layered: a 30-second gist, a 3-minute skim, full read, and (sometimes) deep appendices. Peel as far as you need. Respect for your time is built into the structure.

            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            
            <p>
                My name is Alexander Scanlan — I'm a builder by nature, an optimist by force-of-will, and hopefully an occasional writer. My background 
                is mostly in mobile apps, but I hope to expand into distributed systems, AI/ML, and decentralized infrastructure. Currently,
                I'm focused on <strong>UPLEX</strong>: a federated ledger for externalities.
            </p>

            <p>
                I care deeply about:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Epistemic humility</strong> — knowing what we don't know</li>
                <li><strong>Systems thinking</strong> — understanding relationships, emergence, and feedback</li>
                <li><strong>Local-first tech</strong> — ownership, privacy, resilience</li>
                <li><strong>Intellectual honesty</strong> — showing your work, stating your priors</li>
                <li><strong>Accessible knowledge</strong> — writing that invites, not excludes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I write because it forces me to clarify my thinking. Publishing in public adds useful pressure: if I can't explain it clearly, I probably don't understand it yet.

            <h2>Technical details</h2>
            
            <p>
                This site is built with <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>, hosted on GitHub Pages, and deployed automatically via GitHub Actions. Everything is written in Markdown/MDX. The typography uses system fonts with careful sizing (18-20px body, 1.7 line-height, 60-75ch measure). Colors follow a warm neutral palette with Fox Red (#D0342C) as the accent.
            </p>

            <p>
                The design system prioritizes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Visual calm through generous spacing</li>
                <li>High contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)</li>
                <li>Print-worthy composition</li>
                <li>Fast, lightweight pages</li>
                <li>No tracking or analytics</li>
            </ul>
